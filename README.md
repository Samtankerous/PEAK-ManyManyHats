# Mod
This mod adds 52 hats (and other hat-like accessories) to PEAK! 
All hats were modeled and textured by me.

Requires [Radsi2's PassporPagination mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/Radsi2/PassporPagination/) to work. The mod adds pages to your passport so you can access additional cosmetics.
