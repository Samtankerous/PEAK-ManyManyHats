# Mod
This mod adds 77 hats (and other hat-like accessories), 20 accessories, 12 eye types and 18 mouth types to PEAK! 

Every cosmetic in this mod was made by me. :)


## Dependencies
Requires [Radsi2's PassporPagination mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/Radsi2/PassporPagination/) to work. This mod adds pages to your passport so you can access additional cosmetics.  

The accessories, eye and mouth types require [Cretapark's MoreCustomizations mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/cretapark/More_Customizations/). (This mod isn't necessary for the hats).

For jigglephysics you need [Nealstrof JigglePhysics](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/JigglePhysics/Naelstrof_JigglePhysics/)
