# Changelog
## 1.4.0
- Added jigglyphysics to a bunch of the hats! To get them working you'll need the the Nealstrof JigglePhysics mod (without it there's no jiggle, but the hats still work so it is optional). The physics may cause occasional clipping on a few of the hats, should be minimal though.
- Added one hat: a fork. Because you're a snack.

## 1.3.2
- Oops, fixed now.

## 1.3.1
- Small coding fix. 

## 1.3.0
- Big update! 14 new hats, 20 accessories, 12 eyes, 18 mouths. 
To get the cosmetics to show you'll need the MoreCustomizations mod by Cretapark (link in the mod description and in the dependencies list). The hats will still function without the additional mod.
- Small fixes to the following hats: antenna, astronaut helmet, bee hood, bunny hood, diving helmets, flower hat, goggles,  kitty hood, moth antennae.
